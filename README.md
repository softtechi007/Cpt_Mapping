Good morning, Mrs. Rodriguez. How are you feeling? Good morning. Doctor, I've been feeling very weak and tired lately, and I have a high fever that won't go away. I'm also experiencing severe headaches and pain behind my eyes. I'm concerned it might be something serious. I see based on your symptoms, there's a possibility that you might have Dengue fever, which is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes. Have you noticed any other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, rash, or joint pain? Yes, doctor. I've been feeling nauseous and I vomited a couple of times yesterday. I haven't noticed any rash, but my joints are really achy, especially my knees and elbows. Thank you for sharing that information, Mrs. Rodriguez. It's important for us to consider all the symptoms. Given your symptoms and the prevalence of dengue in our region, I recommend conducting some tests to confirm the diagnosis. We'll need to perform another test to check for the presence of dengue virus antibodies. Additionally, we'll monitor your platelet count closely, as dengue can cause a significant decrease in platelets. OK, doctor, what should I do in the meantime to feel better? While we wait for the test results, it's essential to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. I'll prescribe you some oral rehydration salts to help replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Take them two times a day for three weeks. You can also take acetaminophen with 500 milligrams for fever and pain relief. But avoid aspirin and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as they can increase the risk of bleeding. If your symptoms worsen or you notice any signs of severe decking such as assistant vomiting, abdominal pain or bleeding gums, please seek medical attention immediately. Well thank you doctor. I'll follow your advice and take good care of myself. You're welcome Mrs. Rodriguez. We'll do everything we can to support you through this. Remember, early detection and proper management are key to recovering from dengue fever. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me
